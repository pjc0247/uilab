Thanks for "pixelplacement":http://itween.pixelplacement.com, the "iTween" is a wonderful plugin for programing animation.

The package contains a lot of UI images to be used for loading or refresh time.

In the "Sample" scene, I made some easy loadings for example.

There are eight prefabs in "Assets/Fantasy Loading/prefabs" folder.
You can use any of the prefabs for your game, and change them to any type which you like.

To rotate with fix time, you can use the "FLRotate" script and change the rotatespeed.
To rotate with fix angle, you need to use the "FLRotateSkip" script and change the angle to what you want.

......

You can use one or more script for some amazing loaders.

For more infomation, open the "Sample" scene to learn about them.
